===============

To clone this repository (via the HTTPS method), type:
```
git clone https://github.com/tylerbhumpherys/mystic.git
```

Then navigate inside this cloned repository. 

The data for this project cannot be hosted on GitHub. For lab members on Longleaf, please navigate to my personal directory ("/users/tylerben/mystic) within the lab's workspace and copy the Source_data over to your cloned repo. The code in this repo runs under the assumption that you have copied all source data to a folder called "Source_data" within the repository.

Now, within the cloned repository, build all the project artifacts and the results report by typing one of the following command into the terminal:

Longleaf:
```
sbatch Scripts/run.sh
```
or not on Longleaf:
```
bash Scripts/run.sh
